##  Underwater Object Classification: Rock vs. Mine

This project tackles the challenge of identifying underwater objects as either rocks or mines using machine learning techniques. 

**Project Goals:**

* Develop a robust model to accurately classify rocks and mines based on sonar data.
* Provide a valuable tool for applications in marine exploration, defense, and other underwater operations.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
    * Utilize high-quality datasets containing sonar readings for various underwater objects.
    * Leverage Python libraries like Pandas for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure optimal model performance.
    * Access the project's dataset directly on [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2BJOHt6ROtG-aXhUAMGm6x_IWMT8vM8/view?usp=sharing) for your convenience.

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
    * Employ data visualization techniques (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationships between features.
    * Create visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices to guide feature selection and model building.

3. **Train-Test Split:**
    * Implement the train-test split technique to assess model effectiveness.
    * Divide the data into training and testing sets, ensuring the model learns from a portion of the data and is evaluated on unseen examples.
    * This approach validates the model's ability to generalize to real-world scenarios.

4. **Logistic Regression Model:**
    * Utilize logistic regression, a powerful supervised learning algorithm, for classification.
    * Logistic regression excels in binary classification tasks (rock vs. mine) and offers interpretability of results.
    * The project leverages Scikit-learn's implementation of logistic regression for model creation.  

5. **Model Evaluation:**
    * Assess model performance using comprehensive evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    * Gain insights into the model's ability to correctly classify rocks and mines.
    * Employ confusion matrices to visualize the model's performance across different categories.
